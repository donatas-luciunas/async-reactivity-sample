This repository helps familiarize with async-reactivity approach to browser and server communication.

# Modes

## HTTP REST

HTTP REST mode affects only browser and it provides many benefits comparing to traditional approach:

* Query is lazy loaded (loaded only when actually used in the view)
* Query result is cached and could be reused in multiple components
* Query refresh is replaced by query result invalidation, which is beneficial because cache invalidation does not always result in refreshing (for example when not actually used in the view)

## HTTP Query

HTTP Query needs to be used in browser and server and it provides even more benefits:

* Browser and server shared types and logic
* Query usage in server
* Query takes care of communication between browser and server (API)
* Easier to test

## Socket

Socket mode gives everything mentioned earlier + these superpowers:

* Fully declarative
    * Browser gets granular real-time updates
    * No need to care about refresh
* Query can be adjusted, minimal amount of recalculations is ensured

# Sample

This app provides simple todo list to illustrate async-reactivity capabilities.

User can:

* view todo items
  * filter by text
  * filter by status
* edit todo items
  * change text
  * change status (done / not done)
  * remove
* get notification if not valid not done items exist

There is no data persistence, memory is used.

Code is not shared between modes.

# Packages

## Business Logic

Shared code among server and web.

* [data.ts](packages/business-logic/src/data.ts) (server-only) is a in-memory database. It provides `get`, `write`, `subscribe`, `unsubscribe` methods.
* [Item.ts](packages/business-logic/src/Item.ts) is todo item entity class
* [http](packages/business-logic/src/http) illustrates HTTP Query mode
  * [SampleQuery.ts](packages/business-logic/src/http/SampleQuery.ts) - shared code
  * [SampleQuery.browser.ts](packages/business-logic/src/http/SampleQuery.browser.ts) - browser version
  * [SampleQuery.server.ts](packages/business-logic/src/http/SampleQuery.server.ts) - server version
* [socket](packages/business-logic/src/socket) illustrates Socket mode
  * [SampleQuery.ts](packages/business-logic/src/socket/SampleQuery.ts) - shared code
  * [SampleLiveQuery.browser.ts](packages/business-logic/src/socket/SampleLiveQuery.browser.ts) - browser version
  * [SampleLiveQuery.server.ts](packages/business-logic/src/socket/SampleLiveQuery.server.ts) - server version for communication with browser
  * [SampleQuery.server.ts](packages/business-logic/src/socket/SampleQuery.server.ts) - server version for internal use

## Server

* [http/rest.ts](packages/server/src/http/rest.ts) takes care of HTTP REST mode
* [http/query.ts](packages/server/src/http/query.ts) takes care of HTTP Query mode
* [socket.ts](packages/server/src/socket.ts) takes care of Socket mode
* [monitors.ts](packages/server/src/monitors.ts) illustrates query usage in server

## Web (browser)

* [HttpRest.vue](packages/web/src/HttpRest.vue) illustrates HTTP REST mode
* [Http.vue](packages/web/src/Http.vue) illustrates HTTP Query mode
* [Socket.vue](packages/web/src/Socket.vue) illustrates Socket mode

`async-reactivity-vue` takes care of integration between `async-reactivity` and `@vue/reactivity`

# Highlights

Communication with server is only made when query results are actually used in the template (Expand / Collapse button).

When used in the template, filters have instant effect. Text filter is trimmed, so whitespaces have no effect.

HTTP modes have **Invalidate** button as it is unknown when server state changes (could be changed from another tab). For easier inspection writes do not trigger invalidate. That's why validation messages stay visible until refreshed.

Monitor warning condition can be met after various events:

* text changed
* status changed
* item removed

That's why it is reasonable to monitor query, not specific event.

## Socket mode

`Computed`s keep `Listener`s alive for 3s after last usage (Collapse).

There are no incoming messages about irrelevant changes:

* items are filtered out
* same value written
